“The Lord of the Rings” by J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the greatest fantasy epics ever written. Set in the mythical world of Middle-earth, it tells the story of the struggle between good and evil through the quest to destroy a powerful ring. The hero, Frodo Baggins, must carry the One Ring to Mount Doom to prevent the return of Sauron, the Dark Lord. Themes of friendship, sacrifice, and courage drive the journey. With its rich world-building, invented languages, and deep mythology, it remains a timeless masterpiece of modern literature.
